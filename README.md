## Credentials

In order to obtain your credentials you need to either creating and account or loging in to [dashboard.sinch.com](https://dashboard.sinch.com/).
And after that navigate to [Voice & Video / Apps](https://dashboard.sinch.com/voice/apps) and create a new App.

When you have obtained the Key and Secret you simply change APPLICATION_KEY and APPLICATION_SECRET in the top of the JavaScript files. Start up the app with a webserver and start exploring.
